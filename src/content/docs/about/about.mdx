title: About Me
description: About Holden Hewett
---


I'm an empathetic and curious technical writer. I have an enthusiastic passion for leveraging
technology to help people understand and solve problems through my writing.

My professional experience in the cloud software development, networking and embedded systems, and
security industries has given me the technical know-how and perspective needed to produce clear,
concise, and accurate documentation and UX writing deliverables. As a consumer and enthusiast of all
of those technologies myself, I have a unique perspective on how to communicate these complex
technical topics because I genuinely enjoy learning about them.

I follow a reader-first design philosophy when writing. Inclusivity, accessibility, and usability
are paramount to me when creating documentation. Being able to use not only my technical knowledge
but also my empathy and curiosity to create content that is both informative and engaging for all
who read it is what I strive for in my work.
