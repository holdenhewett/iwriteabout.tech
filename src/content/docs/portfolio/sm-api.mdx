description: A quick start guide for the Resident Management API

The following links are publicly available documentation for some of the Resident Manager API
documentation I wrote while at Eleven Software. The API reference documentation was written in
Swagger Editor (manually editing a YAML file) and displayed in Swagger UI. This API was created and
documented before Eleven settled on Stoplight.io being the primary API documentation tool for the
company.
