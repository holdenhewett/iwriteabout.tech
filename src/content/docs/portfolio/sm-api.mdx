The Eleven Software Resident Management API allows their customers (internet service providers) to
integrate third-party applications into their property management system (PMS). I wrote all of the
documentation for this software while I was working at Eleven Software.

The following links are publicly available documentation for some of the Resident Manager API
documentation I wrote while at Eleven Software. The API reference documentation was written in the
Swagger Editor (manually editing a YAML file), displayed in Swagger UI and followed the OpenAPI
Specification (OAS). This API was created and documented before Eleven settled on Stoplight.io being
the primary API documentation tool for the company.
