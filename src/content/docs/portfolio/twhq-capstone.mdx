title: Technical Writer HQ Capstone Project
description: Writing samples for the capstone project to receive my technical writing certificate from TWHQ
---

To get the "Certified Technical Writer" certificate from Technical Writer HQ (TWHQ), I had to submit
a capstone project exemplifying what I learned. I submitted seven writing samples.

Six examples of work I completed at Eleven Software which I turned in as my capstone project to
receive a Technical Writing certificate from Technical Writer HQ (TWHQ). I redacted or changed some
parts in the examples that were sensitive.

The final piece of work is the API reference documentation for one of our public-facing services.
