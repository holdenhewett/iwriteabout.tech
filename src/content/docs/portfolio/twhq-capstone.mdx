title: Technical Writer HQ Capstone Project
description: Writing samples for the capstone project to receive my technical writing certificate from TWHQ
---

Six examples of work I completed at Eleven Software which I turned in to receive a Technical Writing
certificate from Technical Writer HQ (TWHQ). I redacted or changed some parts in the examples that
were sensitive.

The final piece of work is the API reference documentation for one of our public-facing services.
