description: Examples from the Passpoint API from Eleven Software
---


Images from the Passpoint API reference that I worked on while at Eleven Software. All content in
the images was created in Stoplight.io.

* Reference Doc - Microsite Branding and Customization - Details the parts of a microsite you can
  customize using the API.
* Conceptual Doc - short_name Property glossary entry - Describes how and why the `short_name`
  property is needed and works.
* API Reference - Create a Microsite Endpoint - A single API Reference endpoint that customizes a
  microsite and configures its connection details including the `short_name` property just
  mentioned.

I was in charge of researching and selecting an API documentation tool for Eleven Software to use
for public-facing APIs and I went with Stoplight.io. Its price and features were the most closely in
line with Eleven's needs and was well received by internal and external stakeholders alike.

I worked very closely with the VP of engineering and some software developers on the Passpoint API
reference documentation to create what I've shown here. Some pieces of the API Reference endpoint
image were blurred out because they were still in development at that time.
