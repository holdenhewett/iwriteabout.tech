title: Passpoint API Docs
description: Examples from the Passpoint API from Eleven Software
---

While at Eleven Software, I was in charge of researching and selecting an API documentation tool to
use for public-facing APIs as we wanted to move away from the stock Swagger API reference. I
researched and tested several tools and presented my findings to the product and engineering teams.
I mocked up and presented an existing internal API to the teams and we decided to move forward with
the tool I chose: [Stoplight.io](https://stoplight.io/).

I chose Stoplight as Eleven's API documentation tool for several reasons:

* **Price** - The monthly price for the business plan was well within budget.
* **Licenses** - The ability to rotate licenses was crucial to save money, as we could rotate
  developers in and out of the tool as needed.
* **External access restrictions** - The ability to give early access to the external customers
  through guest licenses enabled Eleven to more closely collaborate with their partners on custom
  APIs.
* **Mock API endpoints** - This capability enables developers to make test calls directly from the
  API reference instead of having to use apps like Postman.
* **Style guide** - The ability to create a style guide to enforce formatting consistency no matter
  who was contributing to the documentation.
* **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)** - The ability to use OAS made onboarding Eleven's developers to
  Stoplight straight forward and efficient.
* **Customization** - The ability to customize the look and feel of the API reference with Eleven's
  branding and custom domains.
* **Collaboration** - The ability to collaborate with the product and engineering teams as well as
  external customers.

After settling on Stoplight, I worked closely with the VP of engineering and lead developers on the
Passpoint API. Passpoint is a Wi-Fi technology that allows users to connect to Wi-Fi networks using
certificates instead of the traditional username and password. This API was Eleven's first attempt
at developing such an API and I was tasked with creating the API reference documentation for it. 

I modeled the API endpoints and responses in Stoplight's API editor and created the rest of the
documentation in Stoplight's UI using Markdown.

 Eleven's VP of engineering. All content in the following sections was created by me in
Stoplight.io.*

and works.

configures its connection details including the `short_name` property just mentioned.
